3,"Thanks for showing interest in availing our AMS service. Please go through the Q&A to have a brief understanding.

=> What's the capital requirement? 

20k is the minimum capital to start. However, return is synonymous with capital. Higher capital would fetch more profit. 

=> What are the charges? 

5k is an advance one-time fixed payment (non refundable) for lifetime account maintenance. No monthly charges.

After starting, 30% of the profit you need to share whenever profit reaches near 10% of your capital. For example, with starting capital of 1lakh, once it becomes 10k, you need to give 3k. Here we will consider Net profit (profit after brokerage, taxes and other expenses).In case of loss, we'll first cover up the loss, bring back profit and then only profit sharing will resume again. 

=> What's the minimum/expected return or risk involved in AMS? 

 => There's no guarantee of min or fixed return like debt instruments (i.e. - Fixed Deposit, Bonds etc). You're venturing into F&O trading which is one of the riskiest financial instruments. You should only invest that much which you're comfortable to lose!!
The performance shown in my channel is past performance of the accounts we manage. We always try our level best to keep it same or better in future too. As our earnings is linked with your profitability, our aim would always be giving decent profit in your account keeping the capital safe. But don't join if you become uncomfortable with negative MTM for the time being and have a notion that Q7 can bring only profit every day/every market conditions in your account without fail. We are no magician or God!!

=> Which segment Q7 works? 

 We work solely in stock option buying (NO option writing/selling). 
 
=> Trades will be intraday or positional? 

90% of the trades do hit our target in Intraday only but if in some cases it doesn't hit, we carry it positionally as the idea is not to forcefully exit it until we get the maximum benefit from a trade setup. Now, to get an Idea of real-time accuracy and risk reward you can go through the real P&Ls of my AMS clients' in Q7 official telegram channel.

Note :- The terms and conditions are non-negotiable. No queries will be entertained on reducing the One-time Operational charges or Profit sharing ratio. Only if you're OK with all the terms then proceed."

17,"There are two kinds of financial instruments

1. Debt (Like Fixed Deposit)

2. Equity (Stocks, Mutual fund etc)

Debt instruments are for protecting capital as it's risk free. It gives a minimum return guarantee (usually 4% to 6% annually)

Equity instruments are for wealth creation but they don't guarantee minimum profit or return per say.

Expected return is based on market scenario.

In my past performance I've been able to give 50% to 100% return in two weeks. But that shouldn't be set as a benchmark for the future also. It might be better or worse but mostly it will hover around the same. There's no guarantee of minimum return as we're dealing with Equity instruments, not with debt instruments like FD or Bonds

I've been publicly posting the real P&Ls along with trade details of my clients' accounts on a capital of varied range to give an idea about the return, accuracy and risk-reward. 

Still select your capital so that we can give you a fair idea -
(Scroll down to see all options)"
18,"Anything above 20k is a good capital to start with

Most have started small and gradually increased the capital

However, return is synonymous to capital. Higher capital would fetch more profit. So, without financially exhausting yourself whatever you are comfortable to start with, you can!!"
19,"We take option calls only. 

You already know max amount you can lose even in any unforseen incident. 

Moreover, in every trade, it won't cross more than 3k. Target is minimum 5k. Usually 15k to 20k we would book. So, risk reward is 1:3+ 

Overall I maintain 90% accuracy. So even if I lose one, in next call I will recover double than what I've lost. Utmost care is being taken to preserve the capital. Moreover, my business grows depending upon your Account's growth, so my sole focus would be to make you profitable. If I make loss, I need to cover up the loss, make profit and then only profit sharing would resume.

I've been a full-time time trader and unlike Excel sheets I've been uploading real P&L of the accounts, that's only possible when you know to how to manage your risk. Being a trader, it's not possible to make profit everytime, but we lose less when we're wrong and earn more when you're right. That's how successful trading works."
20,"It's about available opportunities. If there's opportunity, l will trade for sure. If volatility is too high and we don't get trade set-ups with favorable risk reward, then unnecessary for the sake of trading won't take trade. Capital protection is the prime objective. Profit comes automatically. We focus on the amount of profit we can get in each trade rather than the number of trades. Less trades but high profitability is our motto. When we take a trade, the Idea is to get 10% capital appreciation in each trade.90% case we get it in a day.If not, we carry and book within a day or two. I hope I've been able to clarify your doubt."
21,After near 10% capital appreciation
22,"Yes you can as mentioned in the point no 5 but too frequently login will cause unnecessarily trouble, so it's advised not to."
23,"https://t.me/Q7TradingSolutions/39914

In the above example, net profit is 4.61L & not 4.72L, so net profit that's 4.61L is considered. No other taxes (like individual 30%/20% tax bracket will be taken into consideration)"
24,"As you're paying 5k as one-time fee for lifetime account maintenance, there is no monthly charge. Only 30% sharing when 10% capital appreciation is done."
25,"5k is the one-time fees which is the charge of managing your account for Life time. Once we start, we will share profit only according to 70:30 ratio. There is an operational cost associated with IT system maintenance (where central order placement happens), maintaining superior data for flawless analysis, apart from that managing an account like proper placement of exit orders and perfect execution after 10% capital appreciation ( that's the job of a dedicated person). That's why one-time maintenance fees of 5k is taken. 

It's taken only one time before we start , no extra operational cost. Moreover, in our starting days previous experiences there are people who have got profit and didn't pay heed once I've asked them to pay my share. That's why I've kept this constant for all the client. I feel, if I have to run a business ethically I've to keep certain set of norms for everyone irrespective of personal preference and capital. That's why service rules are same for each and every incumbent clients. 500+ clients have followed this, if you do wish to get associated with us, Kindly adhere to this. There's nothing more we can do about it."
26,Yes. You can maintaining the minimum capital requirement in your account
27,No provided you give prior intimation regarding this.

29,"If you've less capital, your take one lot only, gradually once you book consistent profit, then increase the capital, for one lot 35k is sufficient

Hni clients have doubled their 35k capital to 70k

https://t.me/Q7TradingSolutions/32618

https://t.me/Q7TradingSolutions/39848"
30,"The targets are in tune of 20k to 30k+ for each lot
Though 70% cases it hits intraday. 

But when I give a trade, the intention is not to necessarily exit in intraday only. 

The criterion to exit is to get the desired profit.

However, If you wait for the target, you can double your capital like the way I did in many of my AMS clients' accounts. You can check the p&ls those have been posted regularly. 

If you are satisfied with 7k to 10k intraday gain, you can exit and sit.

So, it's difficult to predict an exact number but it mostly would be similar only"
31,"Yes. You'll get sufficient time to enter.

We don't give calls like buy above or sell below

What we have are 

1. Specific trades

2. With simple entry

3. Just place the order

It'll get executed just like 100% cases as per past data

Plus I'll be there to guide you in case of any need

It means, once you get a call like

Ashok 120 CE buy at 7 to 5.75 sl 5 clbs target 13.50 20+

The price would be 7 or near 7 only like 7.05 or 6.95 like that

You just need to place an order of buy at 7

That's it."
32,"I run my service on quality and not on discount to lure clients, you can go for higher plans to get the Subscription cost reduced but I have never given a discount to my service since the beginning itself. Frankly speaking I already have a decent client base with God's grace. 90% of them renew, so giving a discount doesn't seem viable to me.

Moreover, it's about quality of the trade. You can get Micromax at 3k but Apple iPhone cost 1L.


90% of my Targets do hit. 

Every call takes 20k to 30k capital

Target are above 20k range

Premium clients made 900% return in less than a month

https://t.me/Q7TradingSolutions/39189

My charge is very nominal. Only quality people becomes prime clients. I have selected but long-term clients, out of them 90% renews."
33,"Yes. Definitely. We update important things in the channel only. Even after that if you've any queries, we would be there to resolve"
34,"Well, both are buy levels. In chart it's a buy from 41 but if market falls, it might come to 33 level as well. But target is going to get achieved. So, if you've high capital you should buy at both levels. If you've low capital, you may wait for the 2nd level (but it's not always going to come 2nd level) but here in market money makes money. You've to deal with it."
